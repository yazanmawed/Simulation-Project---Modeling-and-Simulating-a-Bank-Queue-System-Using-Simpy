This simulation approaches the queue system in a bank using a simulation tool called SimPy. Its central aim is to investigate how different variations, such as adding more staff or implementing an appointment pre-booking system, will affect customer waiting times and the overall smoothness of the bank. Three different configurations simulated: a simple configuration with two staff members, then a system where 30% of the customers have appointments, and finally a setup with four staff members. Since the simulation will be able to measure the average wait times and maximum wait times, as well as the time that each of the staff can spend with his customer, the study looks at these configurations for an appropriate balance between reducing wait times and controlling the bank's operating costs. These findings give some helpful hints on the various ways small banks could usefully manage queues. This might have broader relevance to other service businesses.
